# testing with jest

I am teaching myself how to use the jest framework to perform unit tests. 

I created a small array of urls and a function returning matches of the urls based on a given users input.

For example, the array of urls has the keyword dog in them. So, if I call the function with the keyword dog as an argument, the function will return urls with the word dog in them.

I installed jest with npm install --save-dev jest. I updated the package.json to watch for and test the changes in the javascript files.
